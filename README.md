# Obify
Obify is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to simplify the ordering and billing system for small cafes and restaurants. With Obify, each table is assigned a unique table ID that customers can scan using a QR code. This allows customers to easily order from the menu and print the receipt after successful payment. The orders are then sent to the kitchen to start preparing.

## Technologies Used
Obify is built using the following technologies:

* Vue.js: A popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
* Vuetify: A material design component framework for Vue.js.
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable, server-side applications.
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data.
